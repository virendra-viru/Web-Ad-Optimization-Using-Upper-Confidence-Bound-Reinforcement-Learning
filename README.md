 Title: Web Ad Optimization Using Upper Confidence Bound Reinforcement Learning

Description:
This project demonstrates the implementation of Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm for web ad optimization. The UCB algorithm is a popular reinforcement learning technique used to balance exploration and exploitation in multi-armed bandit problems. In the context of web ad optimization, this algorithm helps in determining which ad variant to display to users to maximize the click-through rate and overall performance.

Implementation Highlights:

UCB Algorithm: Implement the UCB algorithm to select the best-performing ad variant based on historical data and exploration-exploitation trade-off.
Simulated Environment: Simulate user interactions with different ad variants to collect rewards and update the UCB estimates.
Visualization: Visualize the performance of different ad variants over time to monitor the effectiveness of the UCB algorithm.
Experimentation: Conduct experiments to compare the performance of the UCB algorithm with other strategies such as epsilon-greedy or Thompson sampling.
